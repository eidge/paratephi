Tephigram Finder
=========

##NOTICE

This app has some bad bad code, it was mainly an experiment with Chrome apps development.

Also the development has come to an halt as I dived deeper into other projects, feel free to fork and continue my work. (I suggest starting by cleaning up the code!)

=========

A Tephigram Finder app for Google Chrome.

Let's you access tephigrams from www.noaa.gov without the need to memorize coordinates and go through multiple menus.

It enables you to find places through google maps or coordinates and save them for later usage.

Any sugestions, tips or critics are welcome either through my email: hugoribeira@gmail.com
