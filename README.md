Tephigram Finder
=========

A Tephigram Finder app for Google Chrome.

Let's you access tephigrams from www.noaa.gov without the need to memorize coordinates and go through multiple menus.

It enables you to find places through google maps or coordinates and save them for later usage.

Any sugestions, tips or critics are welcome either through my email: hugoribeira@gmail.com

Happy Flying :)
